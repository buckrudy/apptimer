# app_timer is a simple timer library


## compile
`make`

## install
`make install`

if encounter an error, maybe should use `sudo`

## How to Use
1. include the header file `apptimer.h`
2. add `-lapptimer` when compile

when can't find the library `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can be use to solve this problem

*To use this library See `test.c`*
